# AngularJS-example
This is a little project to show some of my skills as front-end software developer.

There is a login page and after that a CRUD screen for customer/s -> products

Data is adquired consulting a RESTful service at localhost:8080

AngularJS UI, controllers, directives and services was used for demostration.

Bootstrap was used as main CSS.
